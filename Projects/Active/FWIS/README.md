# FWIS — Stage 0

Facility Workspace Intelligence System. The Chief Engineer's operational workspace: plant status, incidents, and open engineering work in one place.

**Status:** Stage 0 complete · **Phase:** Phase 1, Stage 0 of 2

Governed by `../FWIS-Shift-Turnover-Prototype/CLAUDE.md`. Read that before changing anything here.

## What Stage 0 is

Phase 1 keeps the full spec as its target and delivers it in two stages, because "full spec, no backend" is not simultaneously buildable — live intake needs OAuth, OAuth needs server-side token storage, and offline-first sync needs something to sync with.

**Stage 0 (this) — no backend.** Installable PWA, local persistence, manual record entry. Shift Turnover, Dashboard, Search. Single-user, single-device.

**Stage 1 — backend arrives.** Multi-user and multi-device sync with conflict resolution, then communication-source intake. Blocked on the one architecture decision still open: *which* backend.

## What is built

| Screen | Route | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Dashboard | `#/` | FWIS_VISION §Chief Engineer dashboard |
| Turnover list | `#/turnovers` | FWIS-SPEC-0003 v1.1 Screen C |
| Compose turnover | `#/turnover/new` | Screen A — 7-step wizard |
| Turnover detail / review | `#/turnover/:id` | Screen B — incl. acceptance panel |
| Search | `#/search` | FWIS_VISION §Search |

Plus: installable PWA (manifest, service worker, offline), light and dark themes, IndexedDB persistence.

## Architecture

Vanilla ES modules, no build step, no runtime dependencies. Chosen because the priority order puts Simplicity (5) above Scalability (7), and because a zero-toolchain app is trivially deployable to any static host and trivially cacheable offline. Revisit if Stage 1's sync layer makes hand-rolled state management the bottleneck.

```
index.html            app shell — structure only, no data
manifest.webmanifest  PWA metadata
sw.js                 service worker — precached shell, offline navigation
styles.css            design tokens + both themes
assets/               app icons (SVG, incl. maskable)
src/
  main.js             entry point, routes, boot
  config.js           SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH — org, enums, workflow, limits
  db.js               IndexedDB + sync-ready record envelope
  router.js           hash router
  ui.js               shared render helpers, theme, toasts, connectivity
  turnover.js         domain model — shape, validation, escalation
  screens/            one module per screen
verify/smoke-test.mjs verification method
```

### No hardcoding

Per `CLAUDE.md`, no organizational value, enumeration, limit, or workflow rule appears outside `src/config.js`. Properties own their own buildings, departments, plants, utilities, and roster — switching property at runtime rebuilds all of it, which the smoke test asserts as proof the config layer is real rather than decorative.

Enum values carry their own `severity` token; status colour derives from that token, never from a status name mapped in code.

### Sync-ready records

Stage 0 stores locally but models records as if they will sync, so Stage 1 does not require a migration. Every record is wrapped in:

```js
{ id, type, propertyId, status, data,
  createdAt, updatedAt, createdBy, updatedBy,
  revision,        // monotonic — last-writer metadata
  deletedAt,       // soft-delete tombstone, so deletions are syncable
  syncState }      // "local" until Stage 1
```

## Running

Service workers require a secure context, so this must be **served**, not opened from `file://`:

```bash
python -m http.server 8792
# then open http://localhost:8792/
```

The app works without a network once loaded. Theme follows the OS preference and can be toggled; the choice persists.

## Verification

```bash
npm install playwright && npx playwright install chromium
python -m http.server 8792          # from this directory, in another shell
node verify/smoke-test.mjs
```

**72 assertions**, exits non-zero on failure, covering:

- Routing, including the not-found screen
- Config-driven options, and property-switch rebuilding plants/roster/feeds
- Required-field gating on every step
- Escalation triggers raising and clearing the flag count
- The full compose → submit → review → accept lifecycle
- Clarification requiring comments
- Persistence across reload, and the sync-ready envelope's six fields
- Dashboard and search behaviour, including honest empty and no-match states
- PWA manifest, icon resolution, service worker registration
- **Loading and reading records while offline**
- WCAG AA contrast for eight text styles in **both** themes
- Zero console errors

**Last verified:** 2026-08-02 — 72/72 passed.

Playwright is a dependency of the test only; the app itself has none.

## Known gaps

- **Attachments record metadata, not bytes.** File name, size, type, and caption are stored; the file itself is not persisted. Storing blobs is cheap in IndexedDB but meaningless without sync — deferred to Stage 1 with the rest of the storage story.
- **Incidents and concerns are read-only config fixtures** (`config.mockFeeds`), standing in for Incident Management and the Concerns Tracker. Live intake is Stage 1.
- **Single user.** `config.session` stands in for authentication.
- **The SLA and repeat-clarification escalation triggers are defined but only evaluated on demand** — with no backend there is no scheduler to fire them in the background.
- **PWA icons are SVG.** Installable in Chromium browsers; add PNG fallbacks if a target platform rejects SVG icons.

- `FWIS-SPEC-0003 - Shift Turnover.md` v1.1 — fields, status model, screens
- `FBPOIS-ROLE-0004 - Workflow Authorization Matrix.md` — approval chain, escalation routing
- `FBPOIS-WF-0000 - Workflow Engine Architecture.md` — generic state machine the status model specialises
- `../FWIS-Shift-Turnover-Prototype/` — the validation prototype this ports from; its schema carried over, its code did not
